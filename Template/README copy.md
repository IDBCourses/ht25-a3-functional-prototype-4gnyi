// GOAL //
Navigate your player to reach the black hole to win the game

// MOVEMENT RULES //
Top row keys (Q, W, E, R, T, Y, U, I, O, P) = Move UP
Bottom row keys (Z, X, C, V, B, N, M) = Move DOWN
Middle-left keys (A, S, D, F, G) = Move LEFT
Middle-right keys (H, J, K, L) = Move RIGHT

// SHRINKING MECHANIC //
Hold down any 2 keys from the top row or bottom row at the same time = Player shrinks to half size (20px)
Release keys so only 1 or 0 are pressed = Player returns to normal size (40px)
Use shrinking to squeeze through tight spaces between obstacles

// OBSTACLES //
Stars block your path
You cannot move through stars (collision detection stops you)
Plan your route carefully or shrink to fit through gaps

// WINNING //
When your player is inside the black hole, YOU WIN!
A "YOU MADE IT!" message appears
Your player turns black to show you've succeeded
